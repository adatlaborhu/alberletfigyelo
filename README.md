A very basic BASH script, that e-mailed me automatically when a newly online uploaded lease met with my expectations. In 2015 the real estate market in Budapest went crazy. This script helped to find a nice flat on a reasonable price. Feel free to use if you want.

UPDATE: I have emailed alberlet.hu about this idea, they implemented this feature to their website. :-)
